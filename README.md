# FlightClusteringML

The repository includes some of the codes used for the analysis published in the article:

Fala, N., Georgalis, G. and Arzamani, N., 2023. Study on machine learning methods for general aviation flight phase identification. Journal of Aerospace Information Systems, 20(10), pp.636-647.

Autoencoder_arch.py is the training of the autoencoder as a separete script

MLmodelsPlots.py includes the rest of the analysis about clustering the flight data with various ML methods (including the previously trained autoencoder)
